# Bangladesh-Myanmar Military Buildup: A One-sided Arms Race
## Md. Azmeer Rahman Sorder


### Abstract 
Drawing from the historical relationship between Bangladesh and Myanmar based on cross-border refugee displacement, border disputes, and military standoffs, we study a possible case of an arms race based on a shared trend of increasing military expenditure between the two nations. The empirical approach to investigating a possible arms race between two countries, based on yearly data from 1973 to 2018, resorting to the restricted vector autoregressive model provides uni-directional short and long-run causalities from Myanmar's military expenditure to Bangladesh's. Based on the estimates and contentious issues spanning the last five decades from this analysis, the paper argues that there exists a unilateral threat perception by Bangladesh concerning Myanmar.
